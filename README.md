Collapsed Variational Bayes, based on the recent NIPS paper:

Fast Variational Inference in the Conjugate Exponential Family
James Hensman, Magnus Rattray, Neil D. Lawrence

Mixtures of Gaussians (MOG) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are up, with examples. 

This work depends on some functionality from the GPy project (https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy).
